Version 1: This is a Insertion sort. You start with an empty sorted array. Then
            take a value from the combined array, compare it to each value in the sorted
            array and insert it at the appropriate spot. The worst case is n^2.

Version 2: This is a quick sort. Good on time, worse on memory. Big O of n^2

Version 3: This is a bubble sort. Great on memory, worse on time. Big O of n^2
